Description: A system for building row by row (subject by subject) similarity matrices, based on previous work by Finn et al., (2020) and Camacho et al., (2023). In this package, if you provide a n by 1 vector of data it will compute pair by pair similarity for every value, returning an n by n similarity matrix. For example, if your vector is 150 by 1, you resulting output will be a 150 by 150 symmetric similarity matrix, with a diagonal of 1s.
